# Music Genre Classification Project

This project demonstrates the evolution of music genre classification techniques across multiple lab implementations. Each lab builds upon the previous one, introducing new approaches and improvements.

## Project Structure

- **LAB1**: Initial research and documentation on music genre recognition
- **LAB2**: Basic implementation using Naive Bayes on raw audio files
- **LAB4**: Advanced implementation using pre-extracted features with multiple classifiers

## Overview

The project explores different approaches to music genre classification, from basic audio processing to more sophisticated feature extraction and classification methods. Each lab represents a step forward in accuracy and efficiency.

See individual lab directories for detailed documentation:
- [LAB1 Documentation](LAB1/README.md)
- [LAB2 Documentation](LAB2/README.md)
- [LAB4 Documentation](LAB4/README.md)

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- librosa (for LAB2)
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Usage

Each lab contains its own implementation and can be run independently. See the README.md in each lab directory for specific instructions.
